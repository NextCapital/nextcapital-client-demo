## Full Documentation

Full documentation for the `@nextcapital/client` package can be found at the wiki:

https://github.com/nextcapital/nextcapital-client-demo/wiki

## Getting Started

Please read the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/NextCapital/nextcapital-client-demo/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) for the NextCapital Client before getting started.

Simply run `npm install` to install all packages. Once everything is installed, you can run
`npm run start` to start the dev server (see below for required arguments).

Once the server is running, open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser to view the application.

## Specifying a Solution and Authentication

When starting the demo application, you will need to provide both params for proxy authentication and a solution to use.

For authentication, you can either provide a `jwt` bearer assertion(to exchange for an access token) or a valid access token (to directly use against the API). For example:

- `npm run start -- --solution=nextcapital --exchange-token=jwt:goes:here`
- `npm run start -- --solution=nextcapital --access-token=jwt:goes:here`

By default, the `nextcapital` solution will be used if one is not specified.

Additionally, you may specify an environment with `env`:

- `npm run start -- --solution=nextcapital --exchange-token=<base64> --env=uat`

By default, the `sit` environment will be used. See [server/environments.json](server/environments.json) for a list available environments.

Not all demos will work with all solutions. If a demo is unsupported for the current solution, a message will display when that demo is selected.

JWTs have a limited lifetime. You'll need to restart and use a new JWT once the old one expires.

## Specifying the Localhost Port and Reload Watching

When starting the demo application, there are additional optional params for specifying the port number and whether to live reload.

- `--port=9000` -> the `nextcapital-client-demo` server will now start on `localhost:9000`.
  - Defaults to port `8080`
- `--no-live-reload` -> `nextcapital-client-demo` skips having the build watch for changes with auto reload
  - The live reload server runs on port 8081 if started

Example: `npm run start -- --solution=nextcapital --exchange-token=<base64> --port=9090 --no-live-reload`

## Codebase Overview

### Client

- The main entry point of the application is `js/index.jsx`.
  - This is where the application is configured and first rendered.
- The main React component for the application is `js/DemoApplication.jsx`.
  - This is also where all of the routes for the application are defined.
- Each demo lives within the `js/pages` folder.
  - These demos use shared React components from the `js/components` folder.
- The main HTML page the application uses is `static/index.html`.
- The webpack config (`webpack.config.js`) defines how the app is built

### Server

- The demo express server lives at `server/server.js`
- The API proxy exists at `server/proxy.js`
- The minimal session handling logic lives at `server/session.js`

## Minimal Demo
The [/minimal-demo](minimal-demo) folder contains an example consisting of:

- `package.json` file to describe dependencies needed to build and run the client
- `index.js` to configure and render the client
- `webpack.config.json` webpack config to build the script
- `babel.config.js` configuring webpack will use with babel, needed to transform React JSX
- `index.html` an example html file with minimal client hookup

Together, these files represent the absolute bare minimum of a working integration. This example doesn't work on its own: to get it to function, you'll need to:

- Build a working NextCapital API proxy on your server
- Include the resulting `demo.js` as a script into your existing HTML (and including any other potential HTML changes from our example)
- Modify the `index.jsx` to complete any `TODO` entries.

You can run `npm run build:minimal` at the top-level to build the javascript to the `minimal-demo/dist` folder. The `package.json` is a subset of this repo, so everything will build without issue.

As you can see, Webpack will bundle React and all other dependencies together into a single JavaScript file that can be included in your application (when needed) just as you would any other script.

In general, when `webpack-cli` is installed via `package.json`, you can invoke it as:

```
npx webpack --any --args --can --go --here
```

Ample documentation on webpack, babel, React. JSX, etc... exists elsewhere online if needed.
